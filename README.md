# Game-Of-Live-SenseHat
## quick info
 :warning:Has yet to be finished :warning: \
this project is about a Game of Life Simulation with SenseHat on Raspberrypi. The more sensores the modul had the more i wanted to use so the menuing isnt very intuitive i wanted to build in some of the sensores it had. Also i thougth it was it would be a good idea to start with learning to use multithreading but as you can see i couldnt go in verry deep.
