<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  </a>

This project is about a Game of Life Simulation with SenseHat on Raspberrypi. The more sensores i discovered on the modul the more i wanted to use so the menuing isnt very intuitive but i wanted to build in some of the sensores it had. Also i thougth it would be a good idea to start with learning to use multithreading but as you can see i couldnt go in verry deep.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Before you start you need to connect the [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) to the internet and isnstall the [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sense-hat/) module.

### Prerequisites

if you dont have git install it with this command
  ```
  sudo apt install git
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fett-Mops/Game-Of-Live-SenseHat/
   ```
2. Install sense-hat
   ```sh
    sudo apt install sense-hat
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
heres how to run the programm
```sh
python3 GoL.py
```
by default the colors of the LED's are random but if you dont like that you can use a predefined color like this

```sh
python3 GoL.py blue
```
<div align = "center">
  
   red ðŸŸ¥
   blue ðŸŸ¦
   green ðŸŸ©
   yellow ðŸŸ¨
   purple ðŸŸª
   white â¬œ
   orange ðŸŸ§
   brown ðŸŸ«
 </div>
 brown [101, 67, 33]
 yellow [255, 255, 0]
 purple [106, 13, 173]
 white [255, 255, 255]
 orange [247, 152, 29]
 
or if you wan to use your own color you can define the rgb values itself
```sh
python3 GoL.py 130 200 177
```
### Menue
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
#### secret
in the secrete i would have done a rick roll yet it is very hard to recognize without the audio on a 8x8 display (it plays the audio if your earphones ar connected) 
thats why i decidet to use the Bad Apple as an alternative. it is more recognizable because of the contrast( the whole video is black white). also i recomend to put a paper above the display because it blends the LED's thogether.
here if you want to use ("Never Gonna Give You Up")[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ] by Rick Astley
```sh
python3 GoL.py Rick
```
else it will play (Bad Apple) form ZUN.

if there is someone who really wants to have there own video implemented write an issue or contact me in another way. i know how to implement that but i didnt fellt the need because i already have all the options i could wish for :)
